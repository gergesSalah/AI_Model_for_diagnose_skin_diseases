# diagnose_dental_diseases_AI_Model
# By python(Tensorflow, CNN)
I used many algorithms to get the highest quality and improved on each of them until I was able to build layers
myself and managed to reach 75% accuracy so far.

The quality was 75%, and it was used in a project built in Django, and I received a reward from the university at this
time. The project was developed to help everyone who has a skin disease and wants treatment for it, because I am
the patient. After adding his picture, the system diagnoses him and sends him the name of the appropriate
treatment and guides him. Ali the nearest pharmacy to him
